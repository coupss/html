<h3> <i> <font color="533638" face="Arial Black">	l. My Existence </i> </font> </h3> 
<p> <font color="F5F5DC" face="Courier New"> Like most of the Pinoys, my name is a creative manifestation of American and Spanish colonial influence. I have <b>
<i> 
 Avegail 
 </i>
 </b> as my first name which is a rendition of the common American name 'Abigail' (I absolutely have no idea why my parents did not use the usual spelling. They probably wanted it to be unique, which is rather ironic considering how exceptional their choice turned out to be.) 
My  middle name and surname, on the other hand, <b> <i> Atienza Grande</i> </b>, is of Spanish origin.
I was born on the 6th of August in the Year of the
 Monkey, 2004. I have three siblings but I've only ever lived
with one of them because we have what I would call a "complicated" family situation. I identify as a female and I'm pretty much a progressive thinker.
(All hail the feminists!). I currently reside at a predominantly Muslim community, Purok Banisil, Brgy. Tambler. However, I was originally 
born at Brgy. Labangal. </font>

 <h3> <i> <font color="533638" face="Arial Black"> II. What Am I Up To? </i> </font> </h3>
 <p> <font color="F5F5DC" face="Courier New"> I am an undergradute student at Mindanao State University (MSU) GenSan pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in English Language Studies (BAELS)degree.
 Aside from obtaining this degree, I don't particularly have anything interesting to share; at least for now. </font> 
</p>
<h3>
<i> <font color="533638" face="Arial Black"> III. My Interests 
</i> </font>
</h3>
<p> <font color="F5F5DC" face="Courier New">
My father's lineage have an undeniable love for music, hence it isn't surprising to hear that I, too, have inherited the same preference.
So,
the only technology that I am most grateful to ever exist are wired earphones. Yes, controversial.
 I think they are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSQ48zyWZrY" target=_blank> God of music.</a>
  I love to put them on, isolate myself, and indulge in
the realms of rythm and melodies. <br> <br>

I also take interest in singing. I don't have a crystal-like voice that is at par with competitive singers, so I 
enjoyed it as a hobby.  <br> <br>

I love science. I love astronomy. I love to discover scientific explanations behind things for the sole purpose of knowing.
I love knowledge and it saddens me to think that I only have a lifetime to learn and unlearn.

 Aside from the aformentioned, I also love, adore, cherish, and worship cats. I think they are the best creatures. The fact that they domesticated themselves and were worshipped as Gods in ancient Egypt confirms my assertion. No one can convince me otherwise. Due to my undying love for cats, I own eight of them and they are the sweetest. They follow me around the house and greet me at the gate when I come home. Sometimes, they hog my personal space and sit on my keyboard and reviewers. This gets annoying but I always immediately forgive them because they are incredibly irresistible.
 <br> <br>
 Since
 I'm
 discussing animals, I might as well share a sea creature
 that I hold in the 
 second highest regard--octopuses. I cannot fathom how such intricately designed and peculiar 
 creature can exist here on Earth. They are extremely intelligent and are naturally adaptive to their environment.
 How incredible is that! </font>

One word:
<b>
 SEVENTEEN.
</b>
 Recently, I have been binge watching their content. I started with their reality shows, interviews, and performance videos.
They're really good at entertaining. It's almost as if they part-time as comedians. Their humor isn't the only commendable
aspect of their idol life though as I can attest that they have competent singers and dancers in the group. They also make 
good music regardless of genre. (My bias is DK)
